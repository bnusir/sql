<br>

**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.
<br> <br> **Solution** <br>
        In project management there is a larg part about "Risk planning and decision making" , <br>
        from now on I will re-phrase the statement to be " Risk planning & ethical decision making" , <br>
        in other words I will discuss in more details and on a wider scale the ethical implications of any decision <br>
         and will try to accomodate more diverse team members in the brainstorm sessions.
